    <h2>Lamar Retemyer</h2> 
    <p>Hi, my name is Lamar Retemyer. Well, this would be a continuation of the engagement journey.
        Currently, I am two months away. The big day is April 19! The idea now is to make a song (because I love music!).
        So amidst this semester, I will be focused on making a track. Can I do it and manage my assignments? Only time will tell! However, 
        I know that at the end of the day I will need to work hard to make this work. I am pretty excited!
    </p>
